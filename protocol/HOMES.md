# Homes

A **Home** is a role that a Storage Node can take on.

Homes are a predictable place where data should be sent when communicating with a specific individual.

## Core Idea

- Storage Nodes can become Homes.
- A Home is tied to one or many identities.
- Senders send data to all of individual's Home's to ensure predictable delivery.

## Access Models

Homes may be offered in two ways:

- **Free**: anyone can use the Home without payment.
- **Paid (FairShares)**: access requires an active monthly FairShares payment.

## Why Homes Matter
Homes provide a stable destination for person-to-person communication, so clients know where to send data for a given individual, even when he is offline.
