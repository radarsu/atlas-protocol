# Atlas Economic System

Atlas is a decentralized economic system built on three core layers:

- **FairShares** — ownership units
- **Trust** — social confidence
- **Verification** — identity assurance

The system separates ownership, control, and trust.

## 1. FairShares (Ownership Layer)

### What Are FairShares?

FairShares are permanent ownership units.

- Everyone starts with a fixed initial amount.
- Everyone receives regular income.
- FairShares slowly decrease over time (burn).

FairShares represent your share in the system.

- Work → Paid in FairShares
- FairShares → Lease assets
- Assets → Generate income
- Income → Paid in FairShares

### Assets

Anyone may register an asset in Atlas by transferring it through a FairShares-denominated contract. Atlas does not evaluate the fairness of the price; it only records that the transfer occurred under Atlas rules.

Once registered:

- The asset is recognized and protected within Atlas.
- The asset may be leased, financed, or used as collateral in FairShares-based contracts.

However:

- Capital accumulation limits apply within Atlas.
- Future transfers MUST occur in FairShares to retain recognition.

### Income & Burn

Each participant receives:

- **+96 FairShares per week**

Each participant loses:

- **0.096% of their balance per week**

This creates a natural equilibrium:

> At **100,000 FairShares**, income equals burn.

- Below 100,000 → balance grows.
- Above 100,000 → balance shrinks.

This keeps the system stable and prevents hoarding.

### Why Burn Exists

Burn:

- Encourages circulation.
- Prevents passive accumulation.
- Pushes capital toward productive use.
- Keeps supply stable without debt.

Money is not meant to sit idle.

## 2. Resource Ownership Model

Atlas economic model separates ownership and control.

- Ownership is static and egalitarian.
- Control is dynamic and market-based.

Each citizen is entitled to its share of all natural, accessible resources. To guarantee that in a world of scarcity, no individual can permanently own more than:

> 1 / (number of participants) of any resource.

This prevents permanent monopolies and power concentration.

### Temporary Control via Contracts

If someone wants a larger control over a given resource, they must pay FairShares to owners for temporary lease rights (limited up to 10 years). Ownership does not transfer permanently.

This separates:

- Ownership (foundational and equal)
- Control (market-based and temporary)

When contracts expire, control must be renegotiated. This creates a **contestable economy** instead of permanent concentration of resources and power.

## 3. Credits

Credits are 1:1 backed by FairShares. They represent the temporary delegation of control over your FairShares to another participant. This allows capital to be aggregated and deployed for investments, while permanent ownership remains unchanged.

When Credits are used to purchase assets or settle contracts, the required amount is deducted proportionally from all locked FairShares backing those Credits.

The operator does not choose whose FairShares are affected — the system allocates impact automatically.

## 4. Trust (Social Layer)

Trust is always contextual. It reflects how many people trust your expertise on a given topic. Each verified person has 100 trust points. Trust is allocated using quadratic voting per voter.

Trust determines eligibility to participate in topic-based panels. It reflects peer recognition of expertise in a given domain, eligibility to operate certain nodes, and governance influence.

Trust is dynamic and percentile-based. Percentile tiers update automatically as trust levels across the network change.

- **Top 50%** — Participant
- **Top 50–20%** — Recognized Contributor
- **Top 20–5%** — Highly Trusted
- **Top 5–1%** — System Steward
- **Top 1%** — Core Trusted

Trust does not change base income or burn. It grants responsibility and access to roles, but does not affect base income or monetary rules.

## 5. Verification (Identity Layer)

Verification ensures:

- One person = one account
- Resistance to fake identities

Levels:

- Level 0 — Unverified (read-only)
- Level 1 — Basic checks
- Level 2 — Identity Verified (full rights)

Verification confirms uniqueness.
Public identity may remain pseudonymous.

## 6. Governance

Governance in Atlas is democratic, and decisions are made primarily by voting. Everyone is free to vote on common matters, with an equal vote in policy decisions. Delegation of votes to trusted peers knowledgeable in a given topic is encouraged (voluntary and revocable).

Critical actions require multiple independent confirmations.

Protocol-level variables may only be changed with supermajority voting of 75%.
Economic variables steering may only be changed with supermajority voting of 66%.
Operational decisions are made with simple majority.

## 7. Core Economic Philosophy

Atlas aims to:

- Eliminate permanent monopolies.
- Prevent passive wealth accumulation.
- Encourage productive deployment of capital.
- Separate ownership from control.
- Combine equality of foundation with merit-based opportunity.

Discovery is open.
Authority and Ownership are distributed.
Money circulates.
Control is contestable.
Trust shapes responsibility.

## 8. System Variables and Invariants

Atlas operates around a few fixed economic rules:

- **Equilibrium Balance:** 100,000 FairShares per participant.  
  Income and burn are derived to preserve this balance.

- **Ownership Cap:** No one may permanently own more than 1 / N of any resource (N = population).

- **Lease Limits:** Control over resources is temporary (up to 5 to 10 years) and must be renewed.

- **Fully Backed Credit:** Credits are backed by locked FairShares and do not create new money.

- **Trust-Based Responsibility:** Trust grants eligibility for roles and panels, but does not affect income or monetary rules.

These invariants ensure distributed ownership, contestable control, and long-term monetary stability.

Atlas is not a debt-based economy. It is a circulation-based, ownership-centered, trust-coordinated system designed from first principles.
