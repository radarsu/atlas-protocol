# Identity Verification

Verification Level represents how strongly an identity has been confirmed inside Atlas.

Higher verification levels unlock capabilities that require strong identity assurance, especially where income, governance, and credit are involved.

Verification is multi-step and decentralized.  
Identity authorities are selected deterministically from eligible high-trust registries using publicly verifiable randomness. This prevents applicants from choosing their own validators and reduces collusion risk.

For higher levels, multiple independent authorities must confirm the identity. Verifiers may be required to stake reputation and/or bonded Holds, and confirmations remain publicly challengeable for a defined period.
