# Atlas Order

Atlas Order defines the social, economic, and governance framework built on top of the Atlas Protocol.

While the **Atlas Protocol** provides technical infrastructure (digital documents, identity, registries, contracts),
**Atlas Order** defines how participants may choose to coordinate, allocate capital, and govern collectively.

## Core Principles

### Monetary Equilibrium
- Target equilibrium: **100 000 FairShares per participant**
- Income and burn are derived to preserve this balance.
- No debt-based monetary expansion.

### Distributed Ownership
- No participant may permanently own more than **1 / N** of any resource.
- Prevents permanent monopolies.

### Temporary Control
- Resource control is delegated via time-limited leases (e.g., 1–10 years).
- Ownership remains distributed.
- Control must be periodically renewed.

### Fully Backed Credit
- Credits are backed by locked FairShares.
- Credits grant temporary capital control.
- No creation of unbacked money.

### Topic-Based Trust
- Trust is contextual and domain-specific.
- Determines eligibility for panels and responsibility roles.
- Does not affect base income or burn.

### Open Governance
- All verified participants may vote.
- Delegation is voluntary and revocable.
- Protocol-level changes require supermajority.

## Governance Layers

- **Protocol Layer** – Technical infrastructure (Atlas Protocol)
- **Order Layer** – Economic and governance framework (Atlas Order)

Atlas Order can evolve through collective decision-making while respecting its structural invariants.

## Goal

Atlas Order aims to combine:

- Distributed ownership
- Contestable control
- Circulating capital
- Peer-based trust
- Decentralized governance

It is a system designed to prevent permanent concentration of power while preserving economic dynamism.
