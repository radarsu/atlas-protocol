# Atlas: Governance by Recognized Competence and Random Mandate

Atlas is a governance system built on a single foundational insight: randomness transforms competence into legitimate authority. Rather than appointing rulers or electing representatives, the community continuously allocates trust across three independent pools — civic behavior, domain expertise, and concern competence — and when binding resolution is needed, randomly selected panels from the relevant top-percentile pool decide, inheriting legitimacy no appointment mechanism can match.

The economic foundation — uniform FairShares income, identical burn rates, one-person-one-account — is constitutionally sacred and mutable only by global one-person-one-vote referendum, ensuring that equality cannot be colonized by political power accumulation. Legislative proposals are decided by the full community with votes weighted by demonstrated domain competence, replacing a permanent representative class with a protocol that performs the legislative function without embodying it in an institution.

The system protects itself through layered friction rather than through trust in any individual or body — quadratic costs on trust concentration and proposal costs, Council classification ensuring proposals face thresholds proportional to their systemic impact, and civic trust floors that define genuine community membership without creating hierarchy among members. What emerges is a governance architecture with no permanent ruling class, no philosopher-kings, and no noble lies — only continuous peer recognition, mathematical scarcity, and randomness doing the work that twenty-five centuries of political philosophy attempted and failed to solve through appointment, election, or heredity.

We choose:
- Sortition over Appointment.
- Competence over Popularity.
- Importance Equality over Power Accumulation.

Atlas Order defines the social, economic, and governance framework built on top of the Atlas Protocol.

While the **Atlas Protocol** provides technical infrastructure (digital documents, identity, registries, contracts),
**Atlas Order** defines how participants may choose to coordinate, allocate capital, and govern collectively.

## Core Principles

### Monetary Equilibrium
- Target equilibrium: **100 000 FairShares per participant**
- Income and burn are derived to preserve this balance.
- No debt-based monetary expansion.

### Distributed Ownership
- No participant may permanently own more than **1 / N** of any resource.
- Prevents permanent monopolies.

### Temporary Control
- Resource control is delegated via time-limited leases (e.g., 1-5 years).
- Ownership remains distributed.
- Control must be periodically renewed.

### Fully Backed Credit
- Credits are backed by locked FairShares.
- Credits grant temporary control.
- No creation of unbacked money.

### Layered and topic-based trust
- Trust is split into separate layers - civic, domains, registries (sources of truth)
- Trust in each layer is topic-specific and uses shared pool.
- Determines eligibility for panels and responsibility roles.
- Does not affect base income or burn.

### Open Governance
- All verified participants may vote.
- Delegation is voluntary and revocable.
- Protocol-level changes require supermajority.

## Governance Layers

- **Protocol Layer** – Technical infrastructure (Atlas Protocol)
- **Order Layer** – Economic and governance framework (Atlas Order)

Atlas Order can evolve through collective decision-making while respecting its structural invariants.

## Goal

Atlas Order aims to combine:

- Distributed ownership
- Contestable control
- Circulating capital
- Peer-based trust
- Decentralized governance

It is a system designed to prevent permanent concentration of power while preserving economic dynamism.
